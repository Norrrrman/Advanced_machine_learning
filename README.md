# Advanced_machine_learning

Analysis of the dataset:
In order to analyse the dataset, you have to extract some statistical information from the
given dataset, for example: the type of data, the missing values, outliers, the correlation
between variables, etc. This part should contain also the analysis of the domain application
and explain the goal of the prediction.
Prediction:
1. Use the Regression Line to predict values for some variables (you can choose any
variable as a target. Compute the error.
2. Use a machine learning method in order to predict the class of a new set of objects. You
can use the methods as K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Decision trees, Neural Networks … The obtained results should be validated using some
external indexes as Prediction Error or others. Explain how the hyper-parameters are fixed
and use Cros Valdiation.
The obtained results should be analysed in the report and provide a solution to improve
the results, for example by combining multiple methods.
Visualization:
You can visualize the knowledge extracted from the classification (prediction) in order to
present the results i.e. scatter plots using predicted colours, decision trees,…
Theoretical details:
Give the algorithmically (mathematical) formalism of the method which give the best
results. Explain all the parameters of the used method and their impact on the results.
Some comparison should me made to conclude the project.
